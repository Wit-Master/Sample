<h2>Launch of iPhone SE</h2>
<p><strong>Apple's fans</strong> who love small phones can now tick an item off their wishlist -- the new iPhone SE for 2020 is here, though Apple could have gone even smaller. Starting at $399 (Â£419, AU$749), it's positioned as a "budget phone," and it's now the most affordable iPhone you can buy. (Compare it to other budget phones, such as the Pixel 3A, Galaxy S10E and Galaxy A51.) At this price, Apple hopes to lure in customers who aren't willing to splurge $1,000 or even $700 on, say, an iPhone 11 Pro or iPhone 11.</p>

<h4>More About SE</h4>
<p>The next-generation <em>iPhone SE</em> retains many of the features people have come to know and love about the original iPhone SE, such as a physical home button and compact size. Although the new iPhone SE is slightly larger at 4.7 inches, compared to the original iPhone SE's 4-inch screen, it's still considered a small phone by today's standards. Like the 2016 version, the latest iPhone SE features a single camera on the phone's rear. According to CNET's Andrew Hoyle, it's most similar to the 11 Pro's standard zoom lens. Here's a deeper look into how the new iPhone SE's camera compares to the iPhone 11 Pro's camera system along with some cool camera tricks you can do with the less expensive iPhone. 
Aside from upgraded internals, one conspicuous change to the new iPhone SE is the absence of a headphone jack, a feature Apple has opted to leave out since 2017's iPhone 7.</p>
